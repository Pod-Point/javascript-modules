# Activity bar

This module displays an activity bar across the top of the screen. Currently it only deals with activities of indeterminate length, but a progress bar could easily be added.

## Import

    import { showActivityBar, hideActivityBar } from '@pod-point/activity-bar';

## Use

The activity bar takes no arguments. `showActivityBar` and `hideActivityBar` show and hide the bar, respectively.
